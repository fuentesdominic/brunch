# Brunch

## Description 

Brunch is an application that allows the user to view, edit, and delete restaurants in the Lake of the Ozarks area. You can add restaurants and the items on their menu. Brunch can be used to understand the restaurants on the lake. We added the mile marker of each restaurant there users can get a rough idea of the location of each place.

## Navigating

- A user must sign in to view all of the restaurants
- If you have not signed in you can register with an email and unique password
- Once logged in you can select any restaurant you desire
- All of the menu items and their price will be at the bottom of the restaurant details. Inside here you can create more items, edit existing items, or delete items. At the bottom of the page you can delete the entire restaurant.
- Adding a new restaurant can be found at the top of every page.
- At anytime you can easily navigate back to the home page at the top of every page. 
- Don't forget to checkout the about tab at the header, this will go deeper into the thoughts behind this application.

## Future Changes 

We will be adding a feature where everyone can view each others creation of restuarants but the user who created that restaurant is the only person who can delete it. I would also like to add a comment section to every menu item.
